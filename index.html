        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketingüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Bilingual student currently enrolled in UCR and graduating in June 2024. I‚Äôm studying as a Neuroscience Major hoping to pursue a career as a Neurosurgeon. During my high school years, I‚Äôve gained the experience of working with children and the elderly through community service clubs I participated in. My hours of community service have accumulated to over 400 hours in all of my clubs. I love to interact with new people and build closer connections with people involved in my life. I always try to see the good in people and appreciate people‚Äôs values in life. I want nothing but the best for my peers and friends.<br><br>

        The clubs I was involved in were Men‚Äôs League, Alpha LEO, ASB, AVID, and Spanish Honors Society. I was in ASB during my senior year and it allowed me to grow my ability as a leader and how to cooperate with my peers. I was in Alpha LEO for 2 years and it helped me feel a closer connection to the elderly community as I got to work alongside them. I spent 7 years in AVID, but there was an official club I joined my junior year designed to participate in community services and help other students develop the skills they need to be prepared for college. Men‚Äôs League is one of my biggest accomplishments because I got to be a Cabinet Member during my sophomore year and was promoted to the VP of Social Interactions for my Junior and Senior Year. I was in charge of organizing social events for the club so we can build a closer bond and make everyone feel as if they were in a brotherhood rather than a club, and my duties as an ‚ÄúOfficer‚Äù also meant to participate in over 300 hours of community service and to lead the cabinet members in these events.
<br><br>

       My involvement in sports allowed me to grow as a leader. I joined soccer and track as a sophomore and watched the seniors lead a team to plenty of victories. I built a strong connection with my coaches and was allowed to captain my soccer team during my year as a JV player. If there was ever an argument, I was in charge of settling it. Sports can really humble a person, as you have to learn how to work as a team. Teamwork is important in the future to lead a successful career. 
        </p>
        I‚Äôve also gotten the pleasure to work at Chick-Fil-A for a year and a half, as it helped me increase my Food Handling Experience as well as my Sales Experience. I was assigned to the Drive-Thru Team where we were tasked to promote our new CFA App and to encourage customers to begin scanning for points with the app. I had to deal with frustrated customers and pleased customers throughout my time at Chick-Fil-A as it improved my Customer Service Experience. I can talk to a customer and apologize for any inconvenience and offer them more food as an apology.
